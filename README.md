---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "uTest-testing-practise" repository presents reported bugs in applications proposed by Utest academy. Utest is a crowdtesting platform that allows elevate testing skills. During testing, I learned to report bugs for websites and mobile applications, including correct bugs documentation (screenshots, mp4 movies or recording logs by using Adb Logcat). Several of the reported bugs have become very variable.
